      <li>Summer Feelz: Exciting | Happy | Active</li>
      <li>Aspirational Hobby: If I had all the time and money in the world, 
          I would want to become certified at kayaking. I find it really fun
          and exciting - it's a great workout as well! I've gone kayaking in 
          Singapore and Indonesia before, but I would love to go kayaking at
          some of the <a href="https://www.redbull.com/sg-en/best-kayaking-holidays">
          best paddling locations</a> in the world.
      </li>
      <li>Ask me About: Books! I've been reading books ever since I can 
          remember. My favourite books while growing up were Anne of Green 
          Gables and The Hobbit. I love getting lost in new worlds. I'm 
          currently reading a lot of science fiction and fantasy. I also 
          enjoy classics, mystery, and graphic novels. Recommendations are 
          welcome!

      <li>Summer Feelz: Contempt | Happy | Adventurous</li>
      <li>Aspirational Hobby: If given all the time and money in the world, I would like to travel to different places of the world. <br>I have always liked to explore different cultures. It gives me a distinct perspective of how life is in different places and communities. It gives me a completely new angle to think about possibilities that could exist. And hence, an opportunity like this would be like a dream come alive for me.<br> 
      </li>
      <li>Ask me About: I love painting and going on nature walks. Anything that is natural in the environment has always fascinated me. I love colors and different shades that the sky makes at different time of the day. I feel that painting is a form of self expression that has the potential to convey a very deep meaning. Moreover, I enjoy nature walks because it calms me down and refreshes me to a whole new level.

      <li>Summer Feelz: Lucky | Enjoyable | Fulfilling</li>
      <li>Aspirational Hobby: If I had all the time and money in the world,
        I would want to learn Interior Design. When I was a kid, 
        I liked to watch a television show where interior designers helped
        families living in uncomfortable surroundings. I enjoyed seeing how
        the designer worked with the existing site given to them and
        took on the challenge to create aesthetic yet functional homes for 
        these families. The most common difficulty is the lack of space, and 
        the designer had to always be creative and clever to tackle these problems.
        However, I could imagine the sense of achivement from building a cozy home
        despite all the obstacles and seeing the families loves the new design.
        </li>
      <li>Ask me About: I enjoy doing yoga as it helps me reduce body pain and
        relieve mental stress. I enjoy stretching my muscle which takes away
        my back pain and shoulder pain due to sitting in front of the screen for
        almost entire day. Doing yoga also reminds me to leave some time to slow 
        down the pace of my life and enjoy the current moment.
