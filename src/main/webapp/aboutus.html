            Aspirational Hobby: If I had all the time and money in the world, I
            would want to become certified at kayaking. I find it really fun and
            exciting - it's a great workout as well! I've gone kayaking in
            Singapore and Indonesia before, but I would love to go kayaking at
            some of the

            Ask me About: Books! I've been reading books ever since I can
            remember. My favourite books while growing up were Anne of Green
            Gables and The Hobbit. I love getting lost in new worlds. I'm
            currently reading a lot of science fiction and fantasy. I also enjoy
            classics, mystery, and graphic novels. Recommendations are welcome!

            Aspirational Hobby: If given all the time and money in the world, I
            would like to travel to different places of the world. <br />I have
            always liked to explore different cultures. It gives me a distinct
            perspective of how life is in different places and communities. It
            gives me a completely new angle to think about possibilities that
            could exist. And hence, an opportunity like this would be like a
            dream come alive for me.

            Ask me About: I love painting and going on nature walks. Anything
            that is natural in the environment has always fascinated me. I love
            colors and different shades that the sky makes at different time of
            the day. I feel that painting is a form of self expression that has
            the potential to convey a very deep meaning. Moreover, I enjoy
            nature walks because it calms me down and refreshes me to a whole
            new level.

            Aspirational Hobby: If I had all the time and money in the world, I
            would want to open a dog cafe where dog-lovers can enjoy moments
            playing with dogs, especially for people who do not own a dog
            themselves. Dogs are my favourite animal and they are known to have
            a magic mood-boosting power that can help people cope with
            depression, anxiety and stress. Such a cafe

            Ask me About: I enjoy doing yoga as it helps me reduce body pain and
            relieve mental stress. I enjoy stretching my muscle which takes away
            my back pain and shoulder pain due to sitting in front of the screen
            for almost entire day. Doing yoga also reminds me of focusing on and
            enjoy the current moment.
