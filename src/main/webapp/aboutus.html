        Aspirational Hobby: If I had all the time and money in the world, I
        would want to become certified at kayaking. I find it really fun and
        exciting - it's a great workout as well! I've gone kayaking in Singapore
        and Indonesia before, but I would love to go kayaking at some of the
        <a href="https://www.redbull.com/sg-en/best-kayaking-holidays">

        in the world.

        Ask me About: Books! I've been reading books ever since I can remember.
        My favourite books while growing up were Anne of Green Gables and The
        Hobbit. I love getting lost in new worlds. I'm currently reading a lot
        of science fiction and fantasy. I also enjoy classics, mystery, and
        graphic novels. Recommendations are welcome!

      <li>
        Aspirational Hobby: If given all the time and money in the world, I
        would like to travel to different places of the world. <br />I have
        always liked to explore different cultures. It gives me a distinct
        perspective of how life is in different places and communities. It gives
        me a completely new angle to think about possibilities that could exist.
        And hence, an opportunity like this would be like a dream come alive for
        me.<br />

        Ask me About: I love painting and going on nature walks. Anything that
        is natural in the environment has always fascinated me. I love colors
        and different shades that the sky makes at different time of the day. I
        feel that painting is a form of self expression that has the potential
        to convey a very deep meaning. Moreover, I enjoy nature walks because it
        calms me down and refreshes me to a whole new level.

        Aspirational Hobby: If I had all the time and money in the world, I
        would want to learn Interior Design. When I was a kid, I liked to watch
        a television show where interior designers helped families living in
        uncomfortable surroundings. I enjoyed seeing how the designer worked
        with the existing site given to them and took on the challenge to create
        aesthetic yet functional homes for these families. The most common
        difficulty is the lack of space, and the designer had to always be
        creative and clever to tackle these problems. However, I could imagine
        the sense of achivement from building a cozy home despite all the
        obstacles and seeing the families loves the new design.

        Ask me About: I enjoy doing yoga as it helps me reduce body pain and
        relieve mental stress. I enjoy stretching my muscle which takes away my
        back pain and shoulder pain due to sitting in front of the screen for
        almost entire day. Doing yoga also reminds me to leave some time to slow
        down the pace of my life and enjoy the current moment.
